# Leonardo Da Vinci Medal – Official Institutional Summary

## 1. Overview
The **Leonardo Da Vinci Medal** is an academic distinction awarded within the **IDEA League**, a consortium of five leading European technical universities. The Medal recognises excellence in mathematics, engineering and scientific creativity, especially work that bridges theoretical foundations with applied innovation.

It preserves and extends the intellectual lineage of the historic **Prix Poncelet (1868–present)**, one of Europe’s foundational awards in mathematical and mechanical sciences. The Medal represents the modern continuation of that tradition.

## 2. Historical Continuity
The Medal acts as a contemporary counterpart to the Prix Poncelet, maintaining its scientific spirit while adapting it to the 21st-century research landscape.

It emphasises:
- The historical importance of mathematics in European scientific progress  
- The evolution from classical mechanics to computational and interdisciplinary science  
- The value of research that integrates creativity, engineering and scientific rigour  

This continuity ensures that the values established in 1868 remain academically relevant today.

## 3. IDEA League Universities
The Medal is awarded in annual rotation by the five universities of the IDEA League:

- **TU Delft** (Netherlands)  
- **ETH Zürich** (Switzerland)  
- **RWTH Aachen University** (Germany)  
- **Politecnico di Milano** (Italy)  
- **Chalmers University of Technology** (Sweden)  

These institutions collectively guarantee the scientific integrity, academic prestige and continuity of the Medal.
